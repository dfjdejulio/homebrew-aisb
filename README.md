# homebrew-aisb
AISB tap (experimental)

If I'm going to package up open source software for "homebrew", I may as well put the configurations
where they're of use to other folks too.

My first package: the "main" distribution of netpbm drives me crazy for a variety of reasons, but the
Debian one does not.  I looked into why, and the answer is, "they forked it years ago".  They've been maintaining
their fork, and they support using it outside Debian.  So, I took a little time to package *that* version up,
for my own use.
